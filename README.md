# Exploration of Beauty Standards and Age in Film (1970s-2020s)
The title "Exploration of Beauty Standards and Age in Film (1970s–2020s)" reflects our central inquiry into how film industries, particularly Hollywood, have portrayed ideals of female beauty and age over time. The motivation for this project stems from increasing public discussions around media representation, ageism, and racial inclusivity. Despite growing awareness, mainstream films have historically favored narrow beauty norms—prioritizing youth, whiteness, and slim body types. By leveraging big data tools to analyze leading actresses’ physical and demographic attributes across decades, our project seeks to uncover how these standards have changed—or remained static—amid broader societal shifts.
